Digitization is the process of converting information, data, or content from analog or physical formats into digital formats. This makes it easier for people to deal with legal stuff without having to go to a physical office. 

From filing documents to accessing legal advice, digitization lets people do these things quickly and easily, without having to physically go to a lawyer's office or courthouse. It's a big change from the old way of doing things, where you had to go in person for everything.

## Why now?

Now is the perfect time for digitising legal procedures because technology has advanced a lot, making it easier to do things online. People are already used to doing many tasks on computers or phones, so it makes sense to bring legal stuff online too. Plus, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it's safer and more convenient to avoid crowded places like courthouses. 

Digitization is feasible because many countries already have the necessary infrastructure like internet access and digital devices. Also, it saves time and money for both people and the government since it reduces the need for physical paperwork and in-person appointments. So, by bringing legal procedures online, we can make things simpler, safer, and more efficient for everyone involved.
